## Retro For Today

## Work
Yesterday we turned on the new project Online Scheduler, there seems to have been several issues that we have fixed along the way.

Today we ended up turning off the project completely because there were more constraints for the project which were not previously highlighted


## School

Teacher was very nice. Had 3 homework assignments due today which i had to do quickly(not good)
